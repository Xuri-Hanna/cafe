# CoffeeBuzz - A simple bakery.

A simple, modular, light web shop made from scratch with CSS, JS and PHP. Fully responsive for use with mobile and tablet devices.

## How it works

Deployment on a hosting server is super simple. Given the database schema just create a database on phpmyadmin called 'coffee' and import the coffee.sql file to fill and create the appropiate tables.

Once you have all your SQL database up and running just launch a web browser and navigate to the /index.php page and you'll be up and running.

Feel free to modify all items and modals and color schemes. This is just a simple version for a bakery but it can be adapted to any shop.

### Landing Page.

Users can fully customize size of cover picture and of course the picture itself.

Scrolling down will land them in the shop itself.

Once the users click on a modal they can visualize the order, pick the size and write their name on the order as the barista will need it when calling out their order. They can also choose to pay by card or cash (card payments are disabled for security reasons in this version.)

A very handy feature is the top display live counter that allows the user to visualize in real time a "virtual queue" where they can see how many orders are yet to be fulfilled and so gauge the waiting time until their order is prepared.
